# BigFix + Steampipe

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open-source zero-ETL engine to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

[BigFix](https://www.hcltech.com/software/bigfix) is an endpoint management and security platform that provides real-time visibility and control over endpoints across your organization.

For example:

```sql
select
  name,
  id,
  os,
  last_report_time
from
  bigfix_computer
```

```

| name            | id | os               | last_report_time    |

## Get started

### Install

Download and install the latest BigFix plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install bigfix
```

### Credentials

| Item        | Description                                                                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Credentials | BigFix server credentials (username/password) are required for authentication.                      |
| Permissions | The user must have appropriate permissions to access BigFix API endpoints.                          |
| Radius      | Each connection represents a single BigFix server instance.                                         |
| Resolution  | Credentials must be explicitly set in the Steampipe config file (`~/.steampipe/config/bigfix.spc`). |

### Configuration

Installing the latest bigfix plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/bigfix.spc`) with a single connection named `bigfix`:

```hcl
connection "bigfix" {
  plugin = "bigfix"

  # `server_name` defines the BigFix server hostname or IP address.
  # This is required for connecting to the BigFix server.
  #server_name = "bigfix.example.com"

  # `port` defines the port number for the BigFix server.
  # Defaults to 52311 if not specified.
  #port = 52311

  # `username` defines the username for BigFix authentication.
  # This is required for connecting to the BigFix server.
  #username = "admin"

  # `password` defines the password for BigFix authentication.
  # This is required for connecting to the BigFix server.
  #password = "your_password"

  # The maximum number of attempts (including the initial call) Steampipe will
  # make for failing API calls. Defaults to 3 and must be greater than or equal to 1.
  #max_retries = 3

  # The minimum retry delay in milliseconds after which retries will be performed.
  # This delay is also used as a base value when calculating the exponential backoff retry times.
  # Defaults to 100ms and must be greater than or equal to 1ms.
  #min_retry_delay = 100

  # List of additional BigFix error messages to ignore for all queries.
  # When encountering these errors, the API call will not be retried and empty results will be returned.
  # By default, "not found" errors are ignored and will still be ignored even if this argument is not set.
  #ignore_error_messages = ["Access Denied", "Unauthorized", "Invalid credentials"]

  # Whether to skip TLS certificate verification when connecting to the BigFix server.
  # This should only be used in development or testing environments with self-signed certificates.
  # Defaults to false for security.
  #insecure_skip_verify = false

  # The request timeout in seconds for API requests to the BigFix server.
  # This is useful for environments with slow network connections or large datasets.
  # Defaults to 120 seconds.
  #request_timeout = 120
}
```
